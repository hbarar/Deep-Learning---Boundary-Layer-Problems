# Deep-Learning---Thermal and Flow Boundary Layers
This repositrory contains all the required files to solve nonlinear coupled partial differential equations attributed to the flow and thermal boundary layer problems occuring in Fluid mechanic science. We have explored the capability of Physics-Informed-Neural Network developed by Professor Maziar Raissi and his colleages in Brown university. The original code can be found through (https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs.)
